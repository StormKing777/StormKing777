## 👨‍💻 About Me
I am a multi-disciplinary technologist bridgeing the gap between **IT Infrastructure**, **Cybersecurity**, and **Software Engineering**. My focus is on building secure, scalable applications while maintaining high standards for system integrity.

* 📱 **Mobile App Development:** Currently exploring optimized workflows for frontend and backend integration.
* 🛡️ **Security Mindset:** Applying a cybersecurity lens to every line of code I write.
* 📈 **Business Growth:** Interested in how data-driven engagement can be used to negotiate venture capital funding.

---
- 🔭 **I’m currently working on:** * **Independent Projects:** Building a few side projects to master Project Development.
    * **SaaS:** Developing a software-as-a-service platform focusing on mobile-first user engagement.
    * **Indy Game:** Designing a game using TypeScript logic to explore complex state management that is also mobile-frist user based.
      
- 🌱 **I’m currently learning:** * Deep-diving into **Cybersecurity & Information Assurance** at **WGU**[currently enrolled for my 2nd BA].
    * Actively gaining industry certifications to bridge the gap between development and security.
      
- 👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on:** * Open-source security tools or mobile application workflows. I love building things from scratch!
  
- 🤔 **I’m looking for help with:** * Connecting with professionals for entry-level roles in **Cloud Support, SOC Analysis, or IT Support**. 
    * I'm eager to apply my WGU training and Self-taught software engineering skills in a professional environment.
      
- 💬 **Ask me about:** * My **football career**! I can talk about the parallels between high-level athletics and the grit required for a tech pivot for anyone who has trouble with a hard career change.
  
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** * I held a **World Record in the Long Jump** as a 9-year-old (set in 2002) for 14 years until it was finally broken in 2016[i have screenshot with the website with names alongside Usain Bolt & Carl Lewis]! 🏆
